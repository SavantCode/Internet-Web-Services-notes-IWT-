# **Module II: Introduction to Web Servers**

---

## **1. What is a Web Server?**

**Definition:**
A **web server** is a software or hardware system that **delivers web pages and web content to clients (browsers) over the Internet**.

**Key Points:**

* A web server **hosts websites** and handles **HTTP requests** from browsers.
* It **processes client requests** (like GET or POST), finds the requested files, and **sends them back** to the client.
* Web servers can also **run server-side scripts** (PHP, ASP.NET, etc.) to generate dynamic content.

**Analogy:**

* Think of a web server as a **restaurant**:

  * Client/browser = customer
  * Web server = chef
  * Web page = dish
  * HTTP request = order
  * Response = dish served

## **2. Features of Web Servers**

Web servers have several **important features** that make them efficient and reliable:

1. **HTTP/HTTPS Support**

   * Handles requests using **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or **HTTPS** (secure version with SSL/TLS).

2. **Static Content Serving**

   * Can deliver **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other static files** quickly.

3. **Dynamic Content Support**

   * Can run **server-side scripts** (like PHP, Python, ASP.NET) to generate content dynamically.

4. **Logging and Monitoring**

   * Keeps track of **visits, errors, and traffic statistics**.
   * Useful for debugging and analytics.

5. **Security Features**

   * Supports **authentication, SSL/TLS encryption, and access control**.

6. **Caching**

   * Stores copies of frequently accessed content in **memory or disk cache** to reduce server load and improve speed.

7. **Virtual Hosting**

   * Allows **multiple websites** to run on the **same server using different domains or IPs**.

8. **Scalability**

   * Can handle **many concurrent requests** using threads or processes.

## **3. Caching in Web Servers**

**Definition:**

* **Caching** is a technique where **copies of frequently accessed web content** are stored temporarily so that future requests are faster.

**How it works:**

1. Client requests a web page.
2. Web server checks if a **cached copy** exists.
3. If yes → serves cached content (faster).
4. If no → generates the content and stores it in cache for next time.

**Benefits:**

* Reduces **server load**.
* Improves **response time**.
* Reduces **network bandwidth usage**.

**Example:**

* If a user visits `www.example.com/home.html` frequently, the web server stores a **cached copy** instead of generating it every time.

## **4. Case Study of Web Servers**

### **Popular Web Servers:**

| Web Server             | Description                                                        | Platform            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| **Apache HTTP Server** | Open-source, highly popular, flexible                              | Windows, Linux, Mac |
| **Nginx**              | Lightweight, high-performance, handles many concurrent connections | Linux, Windows      |
| **Microsoft IIS**      | Integrated with Windows Server, supports ASP.NET                   | Windows             |
| **LiteSpeed**          | Commercial, fast, supports caching and dynamic content             | Linux, Windows      |
| **Tomcat**             | Focused on Java applications (Servlets/JSP)                        | Cross-platform      |

**Apache Web Server – Overview:**

* **Open-source** and widely used.
* Supports **static and dynamic content**.
* Provides **modules** for SSL, PHP, URL rewriting, etc.
* Handles **HTTP/HTTPS requests** efficiently.

## **5. Configuring Web Servers**

### **Apache Web Server Configuration Example:**

1. **Installation**

   * On Windows: Use **XAMPP** or **WAMP** package.
   * On Linux: Use package managers like `apt` or `yum`.

2. **Configuration Files**

   * Main config file: `httpd.conf`
   * Key settings:

     * `DocumentRoot` → folder where website files are stored
     * `Listen 80` → port number for HTTP requests
     * `ServerName localhost` → server hostname
     * `LoadModule` → load specific modules (PHP, SSL, etc.)

3. **Starting and Stopping Server**

   * Start: `apachectl start` (Linux) / XAMPP Control Panel (Windows)
   * Stop: `apachectl stop` / XAMPP Control Panel

4. **Testing the Server**

   * Open browser → enter `http://localhost`
   * Should see **default Apache page** or your hosted webpage.

5. **Adding a Website**

   * Place website files (HTML, CSS, JS) in `DocumentRoot` folder.
   * Restart server → website becomes accessible.

## **6. Summary / Exam Notes**

* **Web Server:** Software/hardware that serves web content.
* **Features:** HTTP/HTTPS, static/dynamic content, logging, security, caching, virtual hosting.
* **Caching:** Reduces server load, improves speed by storing frequently accessed pages.
* **Popular Web Servers:** Apache, Nginx, IIS, LiteSpeed, Tomcat.
* **Apache Config Steps:** Install → configure `httpd.conf` → start server → place website files → access via browser.
