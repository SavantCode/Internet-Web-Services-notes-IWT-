## **1. Definition of Browser**

A **web browser** is a software application that allows users to **access, retrieve, and view information on the World Wide Web (WWW)**. It interprets **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies** to display web pages in a readable format.

* In simple words: A browser is a **tool that connects you to websites**. Examples: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari.

---

## **2. Functions of a Browser**

A browser performs several key functions:

1. **Requesting web pages**

   * Sends HTTP/HTTPS requests to web servers when you type a URL or click a link.

2. **Rendering web pages**

   * Interprets **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to display the content properly.

3. **Managing user sessions**

   * Stores cookies, session data, and browsing history.

4. **Security features**

   * Warns about unsafe websites, blocks pop-ups, supports HTTPS encryption.

5. **Navigation**

   * Supports back, forward, refresh, bookmark, and search features.

---

## **3. How a Browser Works (Step by Step)**

1. **User enters URL**:

   * e.g., `https://www.example.com`

2. **DNS lookup**:

   * Browser translates domain name into IP address using **DNS (Domain Name System)**.

3. **HTTP/HTTPS request**:

   * Browser sends a request to the server hosting the website.

4. **Server response**:

   * Server sends back HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.

5. **Rendering the page**:

   * Browser parses HTML → creates DOM (Document Object Model)
   * Parses CSS → applies styles
   * Executes JavaScript → dynamic content
   * Displays final webpage to the user

6. **Caching**:

   * Browser stores files locally to **load pages faster next time**.

## **4. Components of a Browser**

1. **User Interface (UI)**

   * Address bar, back/forward buttons, bookmarks, menus.

2. **Browser Engine**

   * Bridges between UI and rendering engine.

3. **Rendering Engine**

   * Parses HTML, CSS, and displays content (e.g., Blink in Chrome, Gecko in Firefox).

4. **Networking**

   * Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests, DNS resolution, caching, and cookies.

5. **JavaScript Engine**

   * Interprets and executes JavaScript (e.g., V8 in Chrome).

6. **Data Storage**

   * Stores cookies, local storage, cache, and history.

## **5. Types of Browsers**

Browsers can be categorized based on features:

### **A. Text-based browsers**

* Display only text, no images.
* Example: **Lynx**

### **B. Graphical browsers**

* Display text, images, videos, and interactive content.
* Examples: **Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge**

### **C. Mobile browsers**

* Optimized for smartphones and tablets.
* Examples: **Chrome Mobile, Safari iOS, Opera Mini**

### **D. Specialized browsers**

* For specific purposes like privacy or developer tools.
* Examples: **Tor Browser** (for anonymity), **Brave Browser** (privacy-focused)
