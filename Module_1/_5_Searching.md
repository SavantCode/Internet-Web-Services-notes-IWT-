## **1. Search Engines**

### **Definition:**

A **search engine** is a software system designed to **search and retrieve information from the Internet** based on user queries. It allows users to access relevant websites, images, videos, and other types of content.

### **How it works (step by step):**

1. **Crawling:**

   * Search engines use automated programs called **crawlers or spiders**.
   * They explore the web by following links and collecting data from webpages.
2. **Indexing:**

   * Collected data is stored in a **huge database (index)**.
   * The index organizes content by keywords, topics, and metadata.
3. **Processing queries:**

   * When a user types a keyword, the search engine looks through its **index** for relevant pages.
4. **Ranking results:**

   * Pages are ranked based on relevance, popularity, freshness, and authority.
   * Algorithms (like Google’s PageRank) determine the order of results.
5. **Displaying results:**

   * Results are presented as a **list of links** with titles, descriptions, and URLs.

**Examples:** Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo.

**Key points for exams:**

* Search engines automate finding information.
* They rely on **crawling, indexing, searching, and ranking**.

## **2. Search Fundamentals**

Search fundamentals are the **basic principles and concepts you must know to perform effective searches**.

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Keywords:**

   * Words or phrases used to describe what you are searching for.
   * Example: Instead of searching "science," search `"quantum physics experiment"` for better results.

2. **Relevance:**

   * How closely search results match your query.
   * Example: Searching for “healthy recipes” should not return fast-food menus.

3. **Precision and Recall:**

   * **Precision:** Percentage of retrieved results that are relevant.

     * High precision → most results are useful.
   * **Recall:** Percentage of all relevant results that the engine retrieves.

     * High recall → engine finds most of the relevant content available.

4. **Boolean Operators:**

   * Used to **refine searches**.

     * `AND` → results must include all terms.
     * `OR` → results include either term.
     * `NOT` → exclude a term.

5. **Filters / Advanced Search:**

   * Narrow search results using:

     * Date ranges (e.g., last year)
     * File types (PDF, DOCX)
     * Region or language

**Exam Tip:** Using **specific keywords + Boolean operators** improves the effectiveness of your search.

## **3. Search Strategies**

Search strategies are **techniques to get better and faster search results**.

### **Important Strategies:**

1. **Use Specific Keywords:**

   * Narrow your search by using descriptive terms.
   * Example: `"best laptops for programming 2025"` is better than just `"laptops"`.

2. **Use Quotes for Exact Matches:**

   * `"machine learning tutorial"` will search for the exact phrase.

3. **Boolean Logic:**

   * Combine terms logically:

     * `"Python AND Java"` → results with both languages.
     * `"Python OR Java"` → results with either language.
     * `"Python NOT Java"` → results with Python but exclude Java.

4. **Advanced Search Options:**

   * Search engines allow filtering by:

     * **Site-specific:** `site:example.com keyword`
     * **File type:** `filetype:pdf keyword`
     * **Time:** `past year` or `past month`

5. **Use Synonyms / Related Terms:**

   * Helps get broader results.
   * Example: `"car OR automobile"`

6. **Verify from Multiple Sources:**

   * Cross-check information for accuracy.
   * Avoid relying on a single website.

**Exam Tip:** Professors like mentioning **quotes, Boolean operators, filters, and specific keywords**.

## **4. Types of Search Engines**

Search engines can be classified based on **how they gather and display results**.

---

### **A. Directory Search Engines**

**Definition:**

* Organize websites **manually into categories or topics**.
* Users **browse categories** instead of searching by keywords.

**How it works:**

```
Technology → Computers → Laptops → Brands
```

**Pros:**

* Easy to explore topics.
* Organized structure helps beginners.

**Cons:**

* Limited coverage (not all websites are included).
* Slower to update compared to automated search engines.

**Example:** Yahoo Directory (older model)

---

### **B. Meta Search Engines**

**Definition:**

* Don’t maintain their own database.
* Send queries to **multiple search engines simultaneously** and combine the results.

**How it works:**

* You type a keyword → meta search engine queries Google, Bing, Yahoo → collects results → removes duplicates → displays them.

**Pros:**

* Can provide **broader results**.
* Useful if one search engine misses something.

**Cons:**

* May include duplicate results.
* Relies on other engines’ databases.

**Examples:** Dogpile, Metacrawler

---

### **C. Standard / Keyword-Based Search Engines**

**Definition:**

* The most common type today.
* Search based on **keywords entered by the user**.
* Maintain their own **database/index** of web pages.

**How it works:**

1. User enters keywords.
2. Search engine looks in its index.
3. Returns results ranked by relevance, popularity, and freshness.

**Examples:** Google, Bing, Yahoo

**Pros:**

* Fast and accurate.
* Uses advanced algorithms for relevance ranking.

**Cons:**

* May return too many results → user needs filtering.
