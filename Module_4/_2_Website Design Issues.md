# **Website Design Issues**

Website design issues are the common challenges, mistakes, and factors that can negatively affect the usability, accessibility, performance, and visual quality of a website. These issues arise when designers fail to consider user needs, technical constraints, and best design practices.

Website design issues can be grouped into **three categories**:

1. **Usability Issues**
2. **Aesthetic/Visual Design Issues**
3. **Technical Issues**

Let’s go through them one by one.

# **A. Usability Issues (User Experience Problems)**

Usability refers to how easily users can navigate and interact with a website.

### **1. Poor Navigation**

* Too many menu items
* Confusing structure
* Hidden menus
* Missing links
  This makes users feel lost.

### **2. Overloading Users with Content**

* Long paragraphs
* No headings
* Too much text
  Users leave when the site feels overwhelming.

### **3. Lack of Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)**

Examples:

* No “Login” button
* No “Buy Now”
  Users don’t know what to do next.

### **4. Non-responsive Design**

Website doesn’t adjust for mobile or tablet screens — a major modern issue.

### **5. Slow Loading Speed**

Caused by large images, heavy scripts, poor hosting.
Users quit if a page loads in more than 3 seconds.

### **6. Bad Readability**

* Small fonts
* Low contrast
* Too many font styles
  Makes content hard to read.
