# **📌 Architectural Page Mockups – Concept**

An **Architectural Page Mockup** is a **visual blueprint or schematic of a website page** that shows the **layout, structure, and placement of content and elements** before actual development begins.

It is **not the final design**, but a planning tool to **organize content, navigation, and functionality** so developers and designers know what goes where.

## **A. Purpose of Architectural Page Mockups**

1. **Visual Planning:** Helps visualize how content and elements will appear.
2. **Content Organization:** Shows which information goes where.
3. **Navigation Layout:** Helps design menus, buttons, links, and user flow.
4. **Feedback Tool:** Allows clients and team members to review structure before coding.
5. **Time & Cost Saving:** Reduces redesigns by resolving structural issues early.

## **C. Types of Architectural Page Mockups**

1. **Low-Fidelity Mockups (Wireframes):**

   * Simple sketches or black-and-white outlines.

   * Detailed designs with colors, fonts, and images.
   * Close to the **final visual appearance** of the page.
   *  Useful for client presentations.
