**Definition:**
Design sketches are **rough, hand-drawn or digital drawings of a website’s layout and structure**. They are created **before detailed mockups or actual development**, to **visualize ideas quickly and communicate them** to the team or client.

In simple words:

> “Design sketches are the first rough drafts of a website page showing where content, images, menus, and buttons will go.”

## **A. Purpose of Design Sketches**

1. **Idea Visualization:** Quickly translate thoughts into visual format.

2. **Planning Content Placement:** Helps decide where text, images, videos, and menus should appear.
3. **Communication Tool:** Designers, developers, and clients can **discuss layout ideas** before investing time in high-fidelity mockups.
4. **Exploring Multiple Options:** Easy to create **different layouts** and choose the best one.
5. **Time and Cost Saving:** Fixing design issues at the sketch stage is faster and cheaper than later.
