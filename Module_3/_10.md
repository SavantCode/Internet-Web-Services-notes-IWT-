# **Rewriting HTML as XML**

Rewriting HTML as XML means converting an HTML document into **XHTML**, which is the XML version of HTML. XHTML follows strict XML rules so that web pages become cleaner, more consistent, and easier for machines to process.

---

## **Why Rewrite HTML as XML (XHTML)?**

1. **XML rules make documents strict and error-free**
   XHTML forces proper closing tags, nesting, and lower-case tags.

2. **Better compatibility**
   XML-based documents are easier to process with parsers, mobile devices, and other software.

3. **Cleaner and more structured code**
   Helps maintain large websites more easily.

# **Rules When Rewriting HTML as XML (XHTML)**

To convert HTML → XHTML, follow these rules:

### **1. Tags must be properly nested**

✔ Correct:

```xml
<p><b>Text</b></p>
```

✘ Wrong:

```xml
<p><b>Text</p></b>
```

### **2. All tags must be closed**

Self-closing tags end with `/`.

```xml
<img src="img.jpg" />
<br />
<hr />
```

### **3. Tags and attributes must be in lowercase**

```xml
<body bgcolor="blue">
```

### **4. Attribute values must use quotes**

```xml
<input type="text" value="Name" />
```

### **5. Document must start with a DOCTYPE**

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
```

### **6. Must declare XHTML namespace**

```xml
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
```

# **Example: HTML → XHTML Conversion**

### **HTML (original)**

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<img src="pic.png">
</body>
</html>
```

### **Rewritten as XHTML**

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
    <title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <img src="pic.png" alt="" />
</body>
</html>
```

# **Benefits of Rewriting HTML as XML**

* Pages become **well-structured and clean**
* Easier to parse using XML tools
* Better compatibility with mobile browsers
* Ensures strict error checking

Here is a **simple, clear, and exam-ready** answer covering **advantages, disadvantages, and use cases** of **Rewriting HTML as XML (XHTML)**:

---

---

# **Advantages of Rewriting HTML as XML (XHTML)**

1. **Strict Structure**
   XHTML follows strict XML rules, making code cleaner, well-formed, and error-free.

2. **Better Compatibility**
   Works well with XML parsers, mobile devices, and modern browsers.

3. **Easy Processing**
   XML-based structure allows easy processing by machines, scripts, and servers.

4. **Improved Maintainability**
   Clean and consistent code makes large websites easier to manage.

5. **Supports Integration**
   XHTML works well with XML technologies such as XSLT, XPath, and DOM.

---

# **Disadvantages of XHTML**

1. **Strictness Can Cause Errors**
   A small mistake (missing tag, uppercase tag, unclosed element) can break the entire page.

2. **More Time-Consuming**
   Requires careful writing and validation, which is slower than normal HTML.

3. **Not Always Necessary**
   HTML5 is more flexible and widely used today, reducing the need for full XHTML.

4. **Compatibility Issues in Old Browsers**
   Older browsers may not fully support XHTML served as XML (`application/xhtml+xml`).

---

# **Use Cases of XHTML**

1. **Websites Needing Strict Structure**
   When clean and consistent markup is required (e.g., academic institutions, government sites).

2. **Applications Using XML Tools**
   Projects that rely on XSLT, XPath, DOM parsing, or XML-based data processing.

3. **Mobile and Embedded Devices**
   XHTML is lightweight and strict, making it suitable for devices with limited processing capacity.

4. **Content That Must Be Machine Readable**
   Useful when search engines, scripts, or automation tools need reliable structured data.

5. **Web Applications Requiring High Consistency**
   When uniform tag formatting and predictable structure are important.
