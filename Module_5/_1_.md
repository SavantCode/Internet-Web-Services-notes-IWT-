# **1. Introduction to Requirements Engineering (RE)**

**Definition:**
Requirements Engineering is the **systematic process of eliciting, analyzing, documenting, validating, and managing the requirements of a software system**. It ensures the software **meets stakeholders’ expectations**.

**Key Points for Exam (~10 marks):**

1. **Purpose of RE:**

   * Understand what the user wants.
   * Reduce errors and cost by preventing misunderstandings.
   * Serve as a foundation for design, development, and testing.

2. **Stakeholders:**

   * People who have interest in the system.
   * Examples: end-users, clients, managers, regulatory bodies.

3. **Process vs Product Requirements:**

   * **Process:** Steps for developing software (methodology).
   * **Product:** Features and qualities of the software itself.

4. **Characteristics of Good Requirements:**

   * Correct, complete, consistent, verifiable, feasible, and understandable.

5. **Importance:**

   * Prevents software failures.
   * Ensures alignment with business objectives.
   * Facilitates communication among stakeholders.

6. **Example:**

   * Requirement: “The online banking system shall allow users to transfer funds between accounts securely.”
   * Shows **what** the system does (functional) and hints at **quality** (secure).

7. **Challenges in RE:**

   * Ambiguous requirements.
   * Conflicting stakeholder needs.
   * Changing requirements during development.

8. **Outcome of RE:**

   * Clear documentation: Use cases, functional and non-functional requirements, diagrams.

9. **Exam Tip:**

   * When asked “What is RE?”, always include **definition, purpose, characteristics, and examples**.
   * Diagrams like Use Case can fetch extra marks.

10. **Remember:** RE = **Bridge between user needs & software solution.**

# **3. Principles of Requirements Engineering**

**Key Principles (~10 marks):**

1. **Understand the problem first:** Don’t start coding before knowing needs.
2. **Involve stakeholders continuously:** Users should review requirements.
3. **Document requirements clearly:** Avoid vague words.
4. **Prioritize requirements:** Not all requirements are equally important.
5. **Manage changes carefully:** Track revisions and updates.
6. **Consistency:** Avoid conflicting requirements.
7. **Traceability:** Every requirement should be linked to a source or objective.
8. **Feasibility:** Requirements must be realistic technically and financially.
9. **Validation:** Always verify requirements with stakeholders.
10. **Example:** In e-commerce, “The system should support up to 10,000 users simultaneously” is a **high-priority non-functional requirement**.

---

# **4. Requirement Sources**

**Sources of Requirements (~10 marks):**

1. **Stakeholders:** Users, clients, managers.
2. **Existing systems:** Legacy systems or competitor software.
3. **Regulations/Standards:** Legal or industry compliance (e.g., GDPR).
4. **Business processes:** Current workflows and operations.
5. **Market research:** Customer expectations and trends.
6. **Observation:** Watching users interact with systems.
7. **Prototyping feedback:** Early mock-ups give new requirements.
8. **Questionnaires/Interviews:** Directly gather user needs.
9. **Example:** Requirement from regulations: “System must encrypt user data as per GDPR.”
10. **Tip:** Always **validate with the source** to avoid misunderstandings.

# **5. Types of Requirements**

Requirements are **different kinds of statements about the system**. Understanding them clearly helps in exams.

**1. Functional Requirements (FRs):**

* Define **what the system should do**.
* Example: “The system must allow users to log in with username and password.”
* Exam tip: Focus on actions, features, or services.

**2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):**

* Define **how the system should behave** (quality or constraints).
* Examples: performance, security, usability, reliability.

  * “Pages should load in 2 seconds.”
  * “Passwords must be encrypted.”

**3. Domain Requirements:**

* Specific to the **industry or business rules**.
* Example: Banking system must comply with SWIFT transactions.

**4. User Requirements:**

* Written in **simple language** for end-users.
* Example: “I want to search products by category.”

**5. System Requirements:**

* Detailed and **technical**, used by developers.
* Example: “System shall use MySQL database for storing user data.”

**6. Interface Requirements:**

* Define how system **connects with other systems**.
* Example: “The system should send data to the payment gateway via REST API.”

**7. Performance Requirements:**

* How fast or responsive the system is.
* Example: “The website should handle 10,000 concurrent users.”

**8. Safety & Security Requirements:**

# **6. Requirements Notations**

**Requirements can be represented visually or textually** to make them easy to understand.

**1. Use Case Diagrams:**

* Show **actors (users)** and **their actions with the system**.
* Example: User → Login, View Dashboard, Make Payment.

**2. UML Diagrams:**
![alt text](image.png)

* **Class Diagram:** Shows classes and relationships.
* **Sequence Diagram:** Shows how objects interact step by step.

# **7. Requirements Engineering Activities**

**The RE process has 6 main activities:**

1. **Elicitation:** Collect requirements from stakeholders.

   * Techniques: interviews, surveys, observation, workshops.
   * Example: Ask users how they search products online.

2. **Analysis:** Understand, refine, and resolve conflicts.

   * Example: User wants fast search and advanced filters → Analyze feasibility.

3. **Specification:** Document requirements clearly.

   * Use cases, diagrams, or structured text.

4. **Validation:** Check requirements are correct, complete, and meet user needs.

   * Example: Show mock-ups to users for feedback.

5. **Management:** Track changes, priorities, and versions of requirements.

   * Example: Requirement updated from “load 1,000 users” → “load 10,000 users.”

6. **Negotiation:** Resolve conflicts between stakeholders.

   * Example: Marketing wants flashy UI, IT wants simple UI → compromise.

**Exam Tip:**

* Remember **Elicit → Analyze → Specify → Validate → Manage → Negotiate** (sequence matters).

# **1. Introduction to HTTP and HTTPS**

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):**

* Protocol used by **web browsers and servers** to communicate.
* Works on **request-response model**:

  * Browser sends request → Server responds with data (HTML, images, etc.)
* **Port:** 80
* **Not secure**: Data is sent **in plain text**, vulnerable to interception.

**HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):**

* **Secure version of HTTP**.
* Uses **SSL/TLS encryption** to protect data.
* **Port:** 443
* Prevents **eavesdropping, data tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks**.

**Key Features:**

| Feature  | HTTP            | HTTPS                             |
| -------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Security | No encryption   | Data encrypted with SSL/TLS       |
| Port     | 80              | 443                               |
| Speed    | Slightly faster | Slightly slower due to encryption |
| Use      | Basic websites  | Banking, e-commerce, login forms  |

**Example:**

* HTTP: `http://example.com` → Not secure
* HTTPS: `https://example.com` → Secure, padlock icon in browser

**Exam Tip:**

* Always **mention SSL/TLS and encryption** for HTTPS.
* Explain **why HTTPS is important** for sensitive data.

---

# **2. HTTP vs HTTPS**

**Differences (simple table for exam clarity):**

| Feature         | HTTP                | HTTPS                             |
| --------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Security        | None                | Encrypted via SSL/TLS             |
| URL Prefix      | http://             | https://                          |
| Data Protection | No                  | Yes (confidentiality & integrity) |
| Performance     | Faster              | Slightly slower                   |
| Common Use      | Informational sites | Banking, e-commerce, login forms  |
| Port            | 80                  | 443                               |

**Key Point:** HTTPS = HTTP + Security
