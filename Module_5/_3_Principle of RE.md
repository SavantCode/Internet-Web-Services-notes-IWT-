## **1️⃣ Principles of Requirements Engineering**

Principles are **guidelines that ensure RE is effective** for web applications:

1. **Understandability:**

   * Requirements should be **clear, simple, and understandable** by all stakeholders (developers, clients, users).
   * Example: Instead of “System must process transactions,” write “The system must allow users to make online payments using credit/debit cards.”

2. **Consistency:**

   * Requirements should **not conflict** with each other.
   * Example: One requirement says “Website must load in 2 sec,” another says “Website must load in 10 sec.” → This is inconsistent.

3. **Completeness:**

   * All necessary requirements must be **captured**.
   * Example: For an e-commerce site, include login, product search, checkout, payment, and order tracking.

4. **Correctness:**

   * Requirements must **accurately reflect stakeholder needs**.
   * Example: Stakeholder wants mobile users to view products; requirement must clearly specify “Mobile responsive product pages.”

5. **Feasibility:**

   * Requirements should be **technically possible** within budget, time, and technology constraints.
   * Example: Requiring AI-based instant translation in a small project may not be feasible.

6. **Verifiability / Testability:**

   * Requirements should be **measurable or testable**.
   * Example: “Website must load within 2 seconds on average” → Can be verified via testing.

7. **Adaptability / Flexibility:**

   * Requirements should allow **changes** as web applications evolve.
   * Example: Ability to add new payment methods in the future.

## **2️⃣ Requirements Engineering Activities**

RE is not a single step; it’s a **process of multiple activities**:

### **a) Requirements Elicitation (Gathering)**

* Collecting requirements from stakeholders, users, and other sources.
* Methods: Interviews, surveys, observations, competitor analysis.
* Example: Ask users “What features do you want in a social media app?”

### **b) Requirements Analysis**

* Examining requirements for **feasibility, clarity, conflicts, and priority**.
* Example: Analyze if integrating video calling is possible within budget.

### **c) Requirements Specification**

* Documenting requirements in a **formal and structured way** (e.g., SRS).
* Example: Writing functional requirements for login, search, and payment features.

### **d) Requirements Validation**

* Ensuring requirements **accurately represent stakeholder needs**.
* Methods: Walkthroughs, prototyping, feedback sessions.
* Example: Show a prototype login page to stakeholders and confirm requirements are correct.

### **e) Requirements Management**

* Handling **changes, updates, and traceability** throughout the project.
* Example: Midway, stakeholders request dark mode; RE ensures this change is documented, analyzed, and implemented.

✅ **Tip for exams:**
Think of **Principles** as **“qualities of good requirements”** and **Activities** as **“steps to handle requirements”**.
