## **Adapting RE Methods to Web Applications**

**Meaning:**
Traditional Requirements Engineering methods were originally designed for **static, standalone software**. Web applications, however, are **dynamic, interactive, and often evolve rapidly**, so RE methods need to be **adapted** to suit the unique characteristics of web apps.

In short: **Adapting RE = making requirements engineering flexible, iterative, and user-focused for web applications.**

### **Why Adaptation is Needed for Web Applications**

1. **Dynamic Nature of Web Apps:**

   * Web apps often change frequently (new features, content updates).
   * Example: Adding new social media features like Reels or Stories.

2. **Multiple Stakeholders:**

   * Web apps serve diverse users: end-users, admins, content creators, developers, marketers.
   * Example: An e-commerce site needs input from shoppers, warehouse staff, and payment gateway providers.

3. **Short Development Cycles:**

   * Many web applications are developed iteratively or using Agile methods.
   * Requirements must be **flexible and continuously updated**.

4. **Integration Requirements:**

   * Web apps interact with APIs, databases, and third-party services.
   * RE must capture all interface requirements clearly.

### **How RE Methods Are Adapted for Web Applications**

1. **Iterative Requirement Gathering:**

   * Instead of gathering all requirements upfront, collect them **in iterations**.
   * Example: Launch a basic e-commerce website first, then add features like wishlists, reviews, or coupons later.

2. **Prototyping and Mockups:**

   * Use **wireframes, mockups, or clickable prototypes** to clarify requirements.
   * Helps stakeholders **visualize the final product**.
   * Example: A mockup of a login and registration page before coding starts.

3. **Agile / Incremental Development:**

   * Split the web app into **small modules**.
   * Collect, validate, and implement requirements for each module.
   * Example: Implement product search first, then shopping cart, then checkout.

4. **User-Centered Approach:**

   * Engage **end-users frequently** to validate and refine requirements.
   * Example: Conduct surveys or usability testing for website navigation.

5. **Continuous Requirements Management:**

   * Keep updating requirements as web app evolves.
   * Example: Adding support for mobile payments after initial launch.

### **Example Scenario**

**Social Media Web App:**

* Traditional RE might document all features at the start: posting, messaging, video calls, notifications, etc.
* Adapted RE for web app:

  1. Start with basic features: profile creation, posting, commenting.
  2. Collect user feedback.
  3. Add messaging and notifications in later iterations.
  4. Continuously update requirements for mobile apps or new features.
