## **1️⃣ Requirements Engineering for Web Applications – Introduction**

**Definition:**
Requirements Engineering (RE) is the **systematic process of identifying, documenting, analyzing, and managing the needs and expectations of users for a web application**.

**Purpose in Web Applications:**

* Ensures the website or web app **meets user needs**.
* Reduces **errors, delays, and development costs**.
* Provides **clear guidelines** for developers, designers, and stakeholders.

**Example:**
For an e-commerce site:

* Requirement: “Users can filter products by category and price.”
* RE ensures this is **documented, prioritized, and testable**.

## **2️⃣ Fundamentals of Requirement Engineering**

RE is based on some key fundamentals:

1. **Requirement Identification:** Find what the system should do.

   * Example: “Website must allow users to register via email.”

2. **Requirement Analysis:** Check if requirements are feasible, consistent, and complete.

   * Example: Analyze if payment gateway integration is technically possible.

3. **Requirement Specification:** Document requirements in a formal manner.

   * Example: Using **SRS (Software Requirement Specification)** with functional and non-functional requirements.

4. **Requirement Validation:** Ensure requirements are correct and match user needs.

   * Example: Conduct meetings or prototypes with stakeholders for feedback.

5. **Requirement Management:** Handle changes in requirements during development.

   * Example: Adding “dark mode” feature mid-development.
