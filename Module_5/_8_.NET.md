Sure! Let’s cover **ASP.NET** in detail and in a simple, exam-friendly way.

## **Introduction to ASP.NET**

### **1️⃣ What is ASP.NET?**

* ASP.NET is a **server-side web application framework** developed by **Microsoft**.
* It allows developers to **build dynamic, interactive, and data-driven web applications** and websites.
* Runs on the **.NET framework** and now also on **.NET Core / .NET 5+**, making it cross-platform.

In simple words:

> ASP.NET = Technology to create web pages that can interact with databases, handle user input, and display dynamic content.

### **2️⃣ Type of Language**

* ASP.NET is **not exactly a programming language**, but a **framework**.
* Developers use **languages like C# or VB.NET** within ASP.NET to write server-side code.

### **3️⃣ Features of ASP.NET**

1. **Server-Side Technology:** Code executes on the server, not the client.
2. **Rich Toolbox & Designer:** Integration with Visual Studio IDE.
3. **State Management:** Handles sessions, cookies, and application state.
4. **Security:** Built-in authentication and authorization features.
5. **Rapid Development:** Supports drag-and-drop controls and components.
6. **Cross-Platform Support:** With ASP.NET Core, runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### **4️⃣ Advantages of ASP.NET**

1. Easy to **develop and maintain** web apps.
2. Supports **large-scale enterprise applications**.
3. Integrated with **databases like SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL**.
4. Provides **high performance** due to compiled code.
5. Offers **rich libraries and frameworks** (.NET libraries, MVC, Web API).

### **5️⃣ Applications of ASP.NET**

* E-commerce websites (e.g., online stores)
* Banking and finance portals
* Social networking sites
* Enterprise dashboards and intranet portals
* Content management systems (CMS)

### **6️⃣ Basic Template Code in ASP.NET (C#)**

```aspnet
<%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeFile="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="Default" %>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Sample ASP.NET Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <form id="form1" runat="server">
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome to ASP.NET!</h1>
            <asp:Label ID="Label1" runat="server" Text="Hello World!"></asp:Label>
            <br />
            <asp:Button ID="Button1" runat="server" Text="Click Me" OnClick="Button1_Click" />
        </div>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

---

### **7️⃣ Code-behind (C#) Example**

```csharp
using System;

public partial class Default : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // This runs when the page loads
    }

    protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Label1.Text = "Button Clicked! Welcome to ASP.NET";
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* `asp:Label` and `asp:Button` are **server controls**.
* `Button1_Click` event is handled in the **code-behind** (C#).
* Page is **dynamic**: clicking the button changes the label text without editing HTML manually.

### **8️⃣ Key Notes for Exams**

* ASP.NET = Server-side framework for dynamic web apps.
* Uses **C# or VB.NET**.
* Supports **Web Forms, MVC, and Web API**.
* Works with **databases** for dynamic content.
* Security, performance, and scalability are major advantages.
