## **Types of Requirements in Requirements Engineering**

Requirements for a web application are broadly classified into **four main types**:

---

### **1️⃣ Functional Requirements**

**Definition:**
These define **what the system should do**, i.e., the specific functionalities or features of the web application.

**Examples for a web app:**

* User login and registration system.
* Product search and filter on an e-commerce website.
* Posting, commenting, and liking on a social media platform.

**Key Point:** Functional requirements describe **actions, tasks, or functions** the system must perform.

---

### **2️⃣ Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

**Definition:**
These define **how the system performs** rather than what it does. They are about **quality attributes** of the web application.

**Examples:**

* **Performance:** Page should load in less than 2 seconds.
* **Security:** Passwords must be encrypted; HTTPS must be used.
* **Usability:** Website must be mobile-friendly and accessible.
* **Reliability:** Website uptime should be 99.9%.

**Key Point:** Non-functional requirements focus on **performance, security, usability, and reliability**.

### **3️⃣ Interface Requirements**

**Definition:**
These define how the web application interacts with **users, other systems, or devices**.

**Examples:**

* APIs to connect with payment gateways like PayPal or Stripe.
* Integration with third-party services like Google Maps.
* UI elements like navigation menus, buttons, and forms.

**Key Point:** Interface requirements ensure **smooth communication between the system and external entities**.

---

### **4️⃣ Domain Requirements**

**Definition:**
These are requirements **specific to the business domain or industry rules** in which the web application operates.

**Examples:**

* For a banking website: Must comply with PCI DSS security standards.
* For a healthcare portal: Must follow HIPAA regulations for data privacy.
* E-commerce website: Must include GST/VAT calculations for invoices.

**Key Point:** Domain requirements ensure **compliance with laws, business rules, and industry standards**.

| Type               | Description                             | Example for Web App                                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Functional**     | What system should do                   | User login, product search, posting content        |
| **Non-Functional** | How system should perform               | Load time < 2 sec, secure login, responsive design |
| **Interface**      | Interaction with users or other systems | API integration, navigation menus, forms           |
| **Domain**         | Specific to business or industry rules  | Banking regulations, healthcare compliance         |
